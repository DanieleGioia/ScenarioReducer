class Scenario_reducer():
    '''
    Abstract class for a scenario reducer that,
    given a fixed n, reduces an original set of scenarios
    with cardinality N to a smaller one of cardinality n.

    Different strategies can vary, for example, w.r.t.:
    -The statistical distance.
    -The selection order (Fast forward, backward, simultaneous backward, ...).
